# brainfuck-2048

This is a brainfuck implementation of the well-known 2048 game.

I wrote this without using any transcompilers and maybe I will publish the source code in the future as proof (At the moment it's pretty poorly commented so it wouldn't be of use).

## Control

When the program asks you to do so, you can move the tiles with

- **w** upwards

- **a** to the left

- **s** downwards

- **d** to the right

## Testing

The program should work on any interactive interpreter (since you need to control the game while it's running). I wrote it for 8-Bit-sized memory, but it may also work on greater sized cells.

For testing I recommend using these interpreters:

- [http://www.bf.doleczek.pl](http://www.bf.doleczek.pl)

Since these interactive interpreters are quite slow I might try to program one myself in the future.
